# Question no. 7:- List Various type of Drawing methods.

Answer:-

**Steps to create the TCP Client and Server :**

- Drawing (or printing) texts on the graphics screen:
            drawString(String str, int xBaselineLeft, int yBaselineLeft);
- Drawing lines:
drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2);
drawPolyline(int[] xPoints, int[] yPoints, int numPoint);

- Drawing primitive shapes:
drawRect(int xTopLeft, int yTopLeft, int width, int height);
drawOval(int xTopLeft, int yTopLeft, int width, int height);
drawArc(int xTopLeft, int yTopLeft, int width, int height, int startAngle, int arcAngle);
draw3DRect(int xTopLeft, int, yTopLeft, int width, int height, boolean raised);
drawRoundRect(int xTopLeft, int yTopLeft, int width, int height, int arcWidth, int arcHeight)
drawPolygon(int[] xPoints, int[] yPoints, int numPoint);

- Filling primitive shapes:
fillRect(int xTopLeft, int yTopLeft, int width, int height);
fillOval(int xTopLeft, int yTopLeft, int width, int height);
fillArc(int xTopLeft, int yTopLeft, int width, int height, int startAngle, int arcAngle);
fill3DRect(int xTopLeft, int, yTopLeft, int width, int height, boolean raised);
fillRoundRect(int xTopLeft, int yTopLeft, int width, int height, int arcWidth, int arcHeight)
fillPolygon(int[] xPoints, int[] yPoints, int numPoint);
 
- Drawing (or Displaying) images:
drawImage(Image img, int xTopLeft, int yTopLeft, ImageObserver obs);  // draw image with its size
drawImage(Image img, int xTopLeft, int yTopLeft, int width, int height, ImageObserver o);  // resize image on screen
