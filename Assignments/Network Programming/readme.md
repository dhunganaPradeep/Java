# Question no.1:- Define Port, Socket, IP Address and URL.

Answer:-

   **Port :-**

   - Port is a logical construct.
      
   - Port is a number assigned to a processor running on a server
      
   - It is a 16-bit number unsigned integer range from (0-65535).

            From (0-1023), known as "system port or widely known port"

            From (1024-49159), known as "Reserved Port"

            Remaining ports(49159-65535), known as the "dynamic port or client port" used by client while connecting to server.

   - Only one application can run in a single port in a server.
      
   - Ports are used in transport layers.
      
   - Example: HTTPS:80, HTTP:443, FTP:20.

  **Socket :-**

   - Combination o fIP address and Port number is called the Socket.

   - Socket is the end point for the communication.

   - Different types of the Socket are : 

            a. TCP Socket

            b. Datagram Socket

            c. Raw Socket Interface
      
   - It works as an interface between an Application layer and Transport Layer.

   **IP Addresses :-** 

   - An IP Address is an address having information about how to reach a specific host which is a 32-bit unique address number having an address space of 2 ^ 32.
    
   - InetAddress is a class that allows us to work with the IP Addresses belongs to java.net package.

   - InetAddress is the base class of both Inet4Address(IPv4) and Inet6Address(IPv6)

   - Some of the methods present in InetAddress class are:- 

      a. public static InetAddress getByName(String host) throws UnknownHostException:-

         - It returns the instances of the InetAddress class containing the LocalHost IP and Name

      b. public static InetAddress getByAddress(byte IPAdress[]) throws UnknownHostException:-
            
         - It returns the instance of the InetAddress class created from the raw IP Address.

      c. public static InetAddress getLocalHost() throws UnknownHostException

         - It returns the instances of the InetAddress class containing the localhost name and address

      d. public static InetAddress[] getAllByName(String hostName) throws UnknownHostException

         - It returns the array of the instances of the InetAddress class which contains the IP Addresses.


Example program:- "[InetDemo.java](https://github.com/dhunganaPradeep/Java/blob/main/Assignments/Network%20Programming/InetDemo.java)"

      Output :
               Host Name: www.dhunganapradip.com.np
               IP Address: 172.67.196.125

**URL :-** 

   - It is a class that is used to represent URL
    
   - It is a package of java.net.

   - A URL is divided into many sections : 

      ![CHEESE!](Url.png)

Example program:- "[URLMethod.java](https://github.com/dhunganaPradeep/Java/blob/main/Assignments/Network%20Programming/URLMethod.java)"

      Output :
               1. Protocol:- https
               2. Host/Domain:- github.com
               3. Host Authority:- github.com
               4. Port:- -1
               5. Default Port:- 443
               6. Path:- /dhunganaPradeep
               7. File:- /dhunganaPradeep?tab=repositories&type=source
               8. Reference/Anchor:- null
               9. Query String:- tab=repositories&type=source
               10. URI:- https://github.com/dhunganaPradeep?tab=repositories&type=source

# Question no.2:- Write a program to process URL processing.

Answer:-

"[URLMethod.java](https://github.com/dhunganaPradeep/Java/blob/main/Assignments/Network%20Programming/URLMethod.java)"

     Output :
               1. Protocol:- https
               2. Host/Domain:- github.com
               3. Host Authority:- github.com
               4. Port:- -1
               5. Default Port:- 443
               6. Path:- /dhunganaPradeep
               7. File:- /dhunganaPradeep?tab=repositories&type=source
               8. Reference/Anchor:- null
               9. Query String:- tab=repositories&type=source
               10. URI:- https://github.com/dhunganaPradeep?tab=repositories&type=source


# Question no.3 :- Differentiate between URL and URLConnection class in java.

Answer:-

 | URL Class  | URLConnection Class |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| It represents a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and provides methods for working with URLs.  | It represents a connection to a URL resource.  |
| It can be used to create an instance of a URL from a string representation.  | It can be used to establish a connection to a URL and obtain input and/or output streams. |
| It provides methods for accessing the components of a URL such as protocol, host, path, query, etc.  | It provides methods for setting and getting request properties such as headers, cookies, etc.  |
| It can be used to compare two URLs for equality.  | It provides methods for getting the response code, content type, and length of the resource.  |
| It provides methods for encoding and decoding URL strings.  |It supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. |
|It is used to open a connection to a resource identified by the URL.  | It can be used to handle redirects and authentication.  |
| It is part of the java.net package.  | It is part of the java.net package.  |
|Example :- "[URLMethod.java](https://github.com/dhunganaPradeep/Java/blob/main/Assignments/Network%20Programming/URLMethod.java)"  | Example :- "[URLConnectionClass.java](https://github.com/dhunganaPradeep/Java/blob/main/Assignments/Network%20Programming/URLConnectionClass.java)"  |
